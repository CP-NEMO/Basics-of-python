# Basics-of-python
I have been learning python and many other programming languages for some time, but when I started learning I didn't realize how important it is for me to keep a backup of all my project's and program and it really doesn't matter  that whether it is a "Hello World" program or a data structure program or any project. It should all be uploaded and must be saved online for backup and also to be used by others.
